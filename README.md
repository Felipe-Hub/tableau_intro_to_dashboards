# TABLEAU Intro to Dashboards

**1. Create a Bar Chart for Claim Amounts:** <br>
Plot a bar chart showing the average claim amount by policy type.<br>
Add labels and customize colors.<br><br>
**2. Scatter Plot for Age vs. Premium:** <br>
Create a scatter plot with age on the x-axis and premium on the y-axis. <br>
Use color to represent policy type. <br><br>
**3. Pie Chart for Policy Types:** <br>
Visualize the distribution of policy types using a pie chart. <br>
Include percentages in the chart. <br><br>
**4. Line Chart for Claims Over Time:** <br>
Plot a line chart showing the trend of claims over months or years. <br>
Add a trend line. <br><br>
**5. Summary Table:** <br>
Select relevant columns such as “Customer ID,” “Policy Type,” “Claim Amount,” and “Premium.” <br>
Use conditional formatting to highlight high or low values. <br><br>
**6. KPIs:** <br>
Create from 3 to 5 important metrics for your dashboard. <br>
Examples: Total Claims Amount, Average Premium, Claim Frequency, Number of Claims, Loss Ratio, Average Age of Customers, etc. <br><br>
**7. Create a Filter for Age Groups:** <br>
Create a filter for age groups (e.g., 18-25, 26-35, etc.). <br>
Use this filter to dynamically update other visualizations. <br><br>
**8. Design a Dashboard:** <br>
Create a dashboard to insert and arrange the plots you created. <br>
Include titles/subtitles for each chart. <br>
*Hints:* <br>
*i. On the top of your dashboard keep only numbers and gauges (your main metrics / KPIs).* <br>
*ii. On the middle, summarized plots (bar plots, line charts, etc).* <br>
*iii. On the bottom have more detailed plots (tables, etc).* <br><br>
**9. Highlight Insights with Annotations:** <br>
Add annotations (text boxes) to highlight interesting findings. <br>
Explain any interesting patterns and insights. <br><br>

**Bonus:** Create other plots that can provide further insights.
