# TABLEAU Intro to Dashboards

**1. Create a Bar Chart for Claim Amounts:**
Plot a bar chart showing the average claim amount by policy type.
Add labels and customize colors.
**2. Scatter Plot for Age vs. Premium:**
Create a scatter plot with age on the x-axis and premium on the y-axis.
Use color to represent policy type.
**3. Pie Chart for Policy Types:**
Visualize the distribution of policy types using a pie chart.
Include percentages in the chart.
**4. Line Chart for Claims Over Time:**
Plot a line chart showing the trend of claims over months or years.
Add a trend line or moving average.
**5. Summary Table:**
Select relevant columns such as “Customer ID,” “Policy Type,” “Claim Amount,” and “Premium.”
Apply aggregations (e.g., SUM, AVG) to the numeric columns.
Use conditional formatting to highlight high or low values.
**6. KPIs:**
Create from 3 to 5 important metrics for your dashboard.
Examples: Total Claims Amount, Average Premium, Claim Frequency, Number of Claims, Loss Ratio, Average Age of Customers, etc.
**7. Create a Filter for Age Groups:**
Add a filter for age groups (e.g., 18-25, 26-35, etc.).
Use this filter to dynamically update other visualizations.
**8. Design a Dashboard:**
Create a dashboard to insert and arrange the plots you created.
Include titles/subtitles for each chart.
*Hints:*
i. On the top of your dashboard keep only numbers and gauges (your main metrics / KPIs).
ii. On the middle, summarized plots (bar plots, line charts, etc).
iii. On the bottom have more detailed plots (tables, etc).
**9. Highlight Insights with Annotations:**
Add annotations (text boxes) to highlight interesting findings.
Explain any interesting patterns and insights.

Bonus: Create other plots that can provide further insights.
